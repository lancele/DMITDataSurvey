# DMITDataSurvey
data use and skills survey for CA Water Boards

Survey currently located at:
https://lancele.shinyapps.io/DataSurvey/

Survey responses cannot be saved at the moment because shinyapps.io does not allow data storage. This issue should be resolved when moving to the SCCWRP shiny server; however, app as written is vunerable to repeated submissions blowing up size of 'responses.csv', which could crash the server.

TODO:
- [x] Have DMIT and OIMA look over survey app
- [ ] Relocate survey to SCCWRP shiny server
- [ ] Verify that SCCWRP server allows storage and edits to a CSV within the app
- [ ] Modify code to prevent response file from blowing up
- [ ] Add comments to code
